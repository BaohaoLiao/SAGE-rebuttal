## Self-Hinting Language Models Enhance Reinforcement Learning

When signal is lost for hard prompts during RL (all trajectories are wrong), the LLM self-generates a hint to help sampling, improving both prompt usage and LLM performance.

## 🌟 Overview

</div>

When an LLM can’t sample any correct trajectory for a hard prompt, the LLM self-generates a hint from the reference solution for the prompt. The hint is then used together with the difficult prompt as input to the LLM, avoiding advantage collapse and ensuring the sampling of correct trajectories to update the policy model.

Without a hint, some hard prompts are never used for GRPO, while SAGE increases the prompt usage rate by 10% for the weaker LLM.

The usage of hard prompts during RL encourages LLM's exploration, leading to consistently better performance.

Among all methods, SAGE retains the on-policy property of GRPO, having a similar entropy scale. And the learning from hard prompts promotes exploration, with the response length growing steadily for various LLMs.


## 📦 Installation
Our code is based on verl. If you already have a verl environment, you can use it and install the extra packages when prompted.

> **Note:** SAGE has been tested on NVIDIA B200 (Blackwell, sm_100) GPUs. If you use older GPUs (e.g., A100, H100), you may use `cu124` or `cu126` index URLs instead of `cu128`, and adjust the torch/vllm versions accordingly.

1. Create a new environment
    ```bash
    python -m venv ~/.python/sage
    source ~/.python/sage/bin/activate

    # Or use conda
    # conda create -n sage python==3.10
    # conda activate sage
    ```
2. Install PyTorch and build tools
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install uv

    python -m uv pip install torch==2.8.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
    python -m uv pip install torchvision==0.23.0 torchaudio==2.8.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
    python -m uv pip install -U pip setuptools wheel packaging psutil
    ```
3. Install flash-attn (compiled from source, may take ~10 minutes)
    ```bash
    python -m uv pip install flash-attn==2.8.0.post2 --no-build-isolation
    ```
4. Install SAGE and dependencies
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BaohaoLiao/SAGE.git
    cd ./SAGE
    python -m uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    python -m uv pip install -e .
    ```
5. Install vllm (must match torch 2.8.0)
    ```bash
    python -m uv pip install vllm==0.10.2
    ```
6. Pin compatible transformers version

    vllm may upgrade transformers to a version that removes `AutoModelForVision2Seq`. Pin it back:
    ```bash
    python -m uv pip install "transformers>=4.45.0,<4.54.0"
    ```
7. Rebuild flash-attn if torch was changed by vllm

    If vllm modified the torch version, rebuild flash-attn:
    ```bash
    python -m uv pip install flash-attn==2.8.0.post2 --no-build-isolation --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir --no-deps
    ```
8. Install additional dependencies
    ```bash
    python -m uv pip install json5
    ```
9. Verify the installation
    ```bash
    python -c "
    import torch; print('torch', torch.__version__)
    from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams; print('vllm OK')
    from flash_attn import flash_attn_func; print('flash-attn OK')
    from transformers import AutoModelForVision2Seq; print('transformers OK')
    x = torch.randn(2, 2, device='cuda'); print('CUDA OK:', torch.cuda.get_device_name())
    "
    ```
